## Background Context
This project is designed to be completed in pairs, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and pair programming, particularly for the mandatory parts.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students should be able to:

- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
- Understand and explain the Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
- Choose the most appropriate sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Explain what a stable sorting algorithm is.
## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files must compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- Code must adhere to the Betty style.
- No use of global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file called sort.h, which must be include-guarded.

## Data Structures and Functions
The project includes specific data structures and functions for printing arrays and doubly linked lists. These are essential for visualizing the sorting process and its outcomes.

## Structures
struct listint_s: A node structure for doubly linked lists.
Functions
print_array: Prints an array of integers.
print_list: Prints a doubly linked list of integers.
Sorting Algorithms Implemented
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Quick Sort
Each sorting algorithm's implementation includes:

A function that sorts an array or linked list as per the algorithm.
The Big O notation analysis in different scenarios (best, average, and worst cases).
Testing
Instructions and scripts for testing the sorting algorithms with large sets of data are provided. Testing is crucial to ensure the correct implementation and performance of each sorting algorithm.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains:

Source code files for each sorting algorithm.
Header files with function prototypes and data structure definitions.
Big O notation analysis for each algorithm.
Usage
Instructions for compiling and running the sorting algorithms are provided for each algorithm. Users can test these algorithms using the provided main function examples or create their own test cases.
